I am a PhD candidate in the fields of sound/music processing and deep learning applied to singing and speech. My research is funded by the [**ARS**](https://ars.ircam.fr/) project (**A**nalysis and t**R**ansformation of **S**inging style) and done at [Ircam](https://www.ircam.fr/) (Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music). 
My work interests are mainly focused on voice alignment and singing style analysis for both research and musicological applications.  
I'm also teaching tutorials, practical works and a few lectures in computer science and sound signal processing at [Polytech Sorbonne](https://www.polytech.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).

I graduated from the [ATIAM](https://www.atiam.ircam.Fr) (Acoustics, Signal processing and Informatics Applied to Music) Master's program at Ircam in 2018-2019.
