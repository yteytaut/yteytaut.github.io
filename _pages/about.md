Hello world! I am an engineer, scientist and researcher applying machine/deep learning techniques to the audio domain from voice sequences to natural soundscapes. 

I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow in ecoacoustics at the [Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle](https://www.mnhn.fr/) (MNHN), working on automatic soundscape analysis with semi-supervised/unsupervised learning tools. I am also affiliated with the [Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://scai.sorbonne-universite.fr/) (SCAI), in charge of creating new teaching materials to promote artificial intelligence.  

I hold a Ph.D. in voice processing and computer music from [Ircam](https://www.ircam.fr/)-[Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/)  with a research focused on temporal constraints for speech/singing voice alignment and transcription.

My work interests cover a broad range of audio applications including voice alignment, symbolic transcription, music information retrieval, bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, musicological musicology and, more generally, computer music.

I have teached tutorials, practical works and lectures in computer science, signal processing and optics in institutes such as [Polytech Sorbonne](https://www.polytech.sorbonne-universite.fr/), [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and [ENS Louis Lumière](https://www.ens-louis-lumiere.fr/formations/formation-initiale/master-photographie/).
