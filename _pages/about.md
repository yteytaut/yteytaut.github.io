I am a PhD candidate in sound/music processing and deep learning applied to singing and speech. I work at [Ircam](https://www.ircam.fr/) (Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music) as part of the [Sound Analysis/Synthesis](http://anasynth.ircam.fr/home/) team.

My research is funded by the ANR [**ARS**](https://ars.ircam.fr/) project (**A**nalysis and t**R**ansformation of **S**inging style). My work interests are mainly focused on voice alignment and singing style analysis for both research and musicological applications.  

I'm also teaching tutorials, practical works and a few lectures in computer science and sound signal processing at [Polytech Sorbonne](https://www.polytech.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/).
