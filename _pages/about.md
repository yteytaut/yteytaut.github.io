I am a post-doctoral researcher in ecoacoustics at the [Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle](https://www.mnhn.fr/) with a research focus on automatic soundscape analysis with deep learning.

I hold a PhD in sound processing/computer music following my thesis work at [Ircam](https://www.ircam.fr/) (Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music) on temporal constraints for speech and singing voice transcription and alignment.

My work interests cover a broad range of audio applications including voice alignment, music transcription, music information retrieval, bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, musicological musicology and, more generaly, computer music.

I also teach tutorials, practical works and lectures in computer science, sound signal processing and geometrical optics in diverse institutes such as [Polytech Sorbonne](https://www.polytech.sorbonne-universite.fr/), [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) and [Ecole Nationale Superieure Louis Lumière](https://www.ens-louis-lumiere.fr/formations/formation-initiale/master-photographie/).
