In addition to my research activities, I am attached to the [SCAI](https://scai.sorbonne-universite.fr/), one of whose key missions is to promote Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to all audiences and levels. As a temporary lecturer, I am in charge of the creation of AI content for non-specialist students, which will be integrated into their university curriculum (ECTS validation), with help from engineers from the sorbonne.ia project.

Since my doctorate, I have been involved in several courses in French public institutes: [Polytech Sorbonne](https://www.polytech.sorbonne-universite.fr/) (PS), [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) (SU) and [Ecole Nationale Supérieure Louis Lumière](https://www.ens-louis-lumiere.fr/formations/formation-initiale/master-photographie/) (ENSLL). I have mostly teached computer science-related courses but also physical modeling, sound/music processing or optics modules to undergraduate students from L2 to M1.
