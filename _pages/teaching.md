In addition to my research activities, I am involved in several courses in several French public institutes: [Polytech Sorbonne](https://www.polytech.sorbonne-universite.fr/) (PS), [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) (SU) and [Ecole Nationale Supérieure Louis Lumière](https://www.ens-louis-lumiere.fr/formations/formation-initiale/master-photographie/) (ENSLL). 

I have mostly teached computer science-related courses but also physical modeling, sound/music processing or optics modules to undergraduate students from L2 to M1.
