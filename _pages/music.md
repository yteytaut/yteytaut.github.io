I am also a classical guitarist and vice-president of the mandolin orchestra [Pizzicatis](https://www.pizzicatis.fr) and tenor in a musical comedy chorus ([Les Odysées Musicales](https://www.instagram.com/odysseemusicale/?hl=fr)).

More personally, I am passionate about Video Game Music (VGM), both from a compositional point of view and in terms of everyday listening, scientific analysis and even automatic generation.

## Pizzicatis - _Une nuit dans les étoiles_

_"A night among the starts"_ composed by David Laheurte for Cello and Mandolin Orchestra.
