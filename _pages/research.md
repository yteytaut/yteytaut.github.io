My academic research falls into two several areas: Voice Signal Processing and Music Information Retrieval (MIR).

Another main research agenda was to use advanced methods to develop musicological analyses.

During my post-doc, I am getting familiar with a new avenue of research focused on ecoacoustics and bioacoustics. To this aim, I am investigating unsupervised/semi-supervised learning techniques to over a billion audio observations -- national and international soundscape recordings -- to characterize sound categories (biophony, geophony, anthropophony) and try to measure biodiversity richness.
